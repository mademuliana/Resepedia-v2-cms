Tasks Completed:
- Renamed and restructured “total price” fields in Recipe and Ingredient to cost instead of price, and made these cost fields non-editable.
- Added a cost field to the Product table for future calculations like recommended price.

Next Focus:
- Resolve the issue with Recipe total cost calculation on the Product table.
- Add UI fields in Product resource to display:
  * Cost of the item (calculated or stored)
  * Recommended price (calculated)
- Create calculation functions:
  * For Product: Calculate cost and recommended price based on related recipes/ingredients.
  * For Order: Calculate total cost and price based on products and quantities.
