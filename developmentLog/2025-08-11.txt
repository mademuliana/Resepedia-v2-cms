What you’ve done today:
- Designed migrations and models for catering app entities (Ingredient, Recipe, Product, Order).
- Created Filament Resources and forms, including:
  * Ingredient resource with proper fields.
  * Recipe resource with repeater for ingredients.
  * Product resource with relation to recipes.
  * Order resource with relations and tables.
- Implemented dynamic recalculation closures for recipe totals (total calories, total price, per portion values).
- Refined the recalculation closure to flexibly handle different scenarios (total only, per portion only, or both).
- Learned how to handle reactive form inputs properly in Filament without premature saving.
- Improved numeric formatting to always show 2 decimals.
- Explained how to prevent auto-submit on enter for inputs.

Next action list (for tomorrow and next steps):
- Rename and restructure “total price” fields in Recipe and Ingredient to be cost instead of price (and make these cost fields non-editable).
- Add a cost field to the Product table, which will be used later for calculations like recommended price.
- Add UI fields in Product resource to display:
  * Cost of the item (calculated or stored)
  * Recommended price (calculated)
- Create calculation functions:
  * For Product: Calculate cost and recommended price based on related recipes/ingredients.
  * For Order: Calculate total cost and price based on products and quantities.
- (Optional) Write seeders or update existing ones to populate new cost fields with dummy data.
